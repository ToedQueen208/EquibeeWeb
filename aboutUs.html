            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>EquiBee is a youth-led organisation with high aspirations to support individuals with their personal development, particularly within the remit of providing tools for them to navigate through the world in a way that works best for them over societal expectations of them.

            We aspire to live in a world where young adults are not ‘lost in the system’, feel connected to their local community, and are satisfied by the direction of their life. To do this, we aim to:
                
            <li>support individuals to receive support from organisations effectively.</li>
            <li>support individuals to identify and develop skills that can personally benefit them.</li>
            <li>foster a community to increase engagement of individuals with the local community.</li>
            <li>provide offers that flexibly adapt to the support needs of the individuals and community we support.</li>
