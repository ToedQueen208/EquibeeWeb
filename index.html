            <h2>Our Values</h2>
            <h3>Equity and Inclusion</h3>
            <p>We believe in a holistic approach to our offers. We know everyone has different priorities and needs, and we want to ensure our offers are as accessible as possible. In creating this organisation, our team all undertook training in equity and inclusion in order to ensure we all understand what equity looks like.</p>
            <h3>Personal Fulfilment</h3>
            <p>We believe in supporting and spotlighting an individualâ€™s goals to personal life satisfaction. While this might change as life changes, we believe that championing these goals can keep life satisfaction as a consistent priority. </p>
            <h3>Little Steps</h3>
            <p>We believe in highlighting and celebrating all the little steps needed to undertake a goal, however big or small. As we are a very neurodiverse team, we know how even the smallest task is full of multiple mini-steps, and this applies to goals too. </p>
            <h3>Community Connections</h3>
            <p>Most personal goals can be positively impacted through community connections. Whether through local organisations or like-minded peers, the community is an invaluable resource that we believe strongly in utilising.</p>

            <h2>Who Do We Support?</h2>
            <p>Our organisation was created to help support people who tend to fall through the cracks. As such, our offers aim to be as inclusive to the people who need it with minimal barriers.<br>
            Some of our offers will have limits and criteria to those who can apply - this will be due to funding agreements. If the offer provided would be a great support to you but you do not fulfil the criteria, please contact us as with enough demand we can create new offers.<br>
            As we are emerging adults ourselves, we have chosen to direct our research and offers towards a similar market (20 - 35 years old). However, we recognise that anyone may identify with the experience of feeling lost and disconnected, and may benefit from our offers. If you are uncertain if you are able to join our community and take advantage of our offers, please contact us.</p>
